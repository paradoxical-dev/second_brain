# Undeclared Programs

## Ollama

- The configuration of the service is included in configuration.nix but the initial bootstrap of the program needs to be done from the install link

## Neovim

- Neovim is installed using home-manager and set to the default editor within it however, the configuration of neovim is still held within the .config/nvim

## Hyprland

- Hyprland is also included in the configuration.nix file but is configured from the default .config/hypr
- Same for waybar, hyprpaper, etc.
